There is a fence around the swings and in fact the whole park is surrounded by a robust fence (punctuated by gates, of course). A track around the large grassy area of the park allows children to do circuits on their bikes, scooters or tricycles.<br /><br />For the adults there is also an exercise playground with rowing and climbing machines.  The climbing machine seams, to me at least, to be particularly hard to use.
