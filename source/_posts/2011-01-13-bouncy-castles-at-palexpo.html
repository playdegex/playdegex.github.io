In the winter months, however, one of the halls is taken over by <a href="http://www.espacejunior.com/content/8-salles-de-jeux">Espace Junior</a>.<br /><br />The room is filled to bursting with bouncy castles, I counted at least 20 in total. There are also trampolines, battery go-karts and self propelled vehicles for the younger ones. This year the charge was 12 CHF for each child and adults were free, the go-karts require an extra token. There's a small shop selling ice-creams, coffee and beer. They have tables and benches to allow you to bring your own food or even host a children's birthday party. <br /><br />Certainly this place has to be visited at least once over the winter season.
