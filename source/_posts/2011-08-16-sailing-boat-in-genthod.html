Play structures include a sailing boat, an arial runway, a sandpit and various wooden climbing frames.<br />It's a short walk from this park to the lake side where you can have a wee paddle. Go down the hill, past the train station and you're there. I think you are really meant to land here on your yacht and head to <a href="http://www.creuxdegenthod.com/">Le Creux-de-Gentold</a> for your filet de perches... but we just stopped for ice-cream.
