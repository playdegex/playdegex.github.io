It's made from tubular steel and the slide (not in picture here) is made up of just two metal tubes. I presume that the climbing frame's design is based on a ship's crow nest but it perfectly echos the turrets of the adjacent Chateau (now housing the Marie and the village school).<br /><br />In the playground there are also some swings and an (eau non potable) water fountain.
