The [Eaux-Vives][eaux] park borders Lake Geneva close to the Jet d'Eau. 
The park itself is beautifully kept with very impressive flower beds. On 
a hot day the park has a well shaded paddling pool which is not photographed here.

To find the playground walk uphill to the top of the park. The cafe in the 
park has ice-creams and a reasonable menu-du-jour. As well as the main 
wooden climbing frame there are some easy swings for toddlers. 
The day we were there free deck chairs were are also available.
