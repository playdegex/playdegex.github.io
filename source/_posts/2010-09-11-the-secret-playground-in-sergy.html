It seems Sergy was listening and they have updated. A big climbing frame with a wooden chip floor. There are some swings and some springy things.<br /><br />It's &nbsp;a large green space and very quiet. It also has an excellent two lane 100m athletics circle for scooter races.<br /><br />Top tip is to go on Thursday when there is also a take away pizza van on the opposite side of the road.<br /><br />The playground is located behind Sergy's school.</div>
