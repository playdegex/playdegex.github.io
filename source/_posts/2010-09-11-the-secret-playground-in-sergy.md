Two years ago I commented on Sergy's playground with some harsh 
comments. It seems Sergy was listening and they have updated. 
A big climbing frame with a wooden chip floor. There are some swings 
and some springy things.

It's a large green space and very quiet. It also has an excellent two 
lane 100m athletics circle for scooter races.

Top tip is to go on Thursday when there is also a take away 
pizza van on the opposite side of the road. The playground is located 
behind Sergy's school.
