Hermance is a very pretty village that boasts one of the best kept lake side beaches there is. It's a great place for swimming and the playground and sandpit are also extremely well located. The views of Lake Geneva are among the best. There is also a buvette selling wine, beer, <em>saucisse</em> and ice cream. To get to Hermance there is a ferry from Nyon or it is the last stop on Bus E 25 minutes from the center of Geneva. The plage costs 4CHF per adult to enter. Hermance plage is incredibly well kept.<br /><br />The village itself has a few shops, restaurants and a large stone tower.
