As well as a play area there are children's beds and cots.&nbsp; The room is open from 08:30 I believe but I have heard of it being opened especially over night for people stuck at the airport. It can be quite tricky to find and is flight side just after the security check.<br /><br />This place is so good it is worthwhile coming to the airport a bit early in order to spend some time there.
