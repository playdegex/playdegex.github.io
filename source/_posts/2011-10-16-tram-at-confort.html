It has a lovely surprise in its centre - a smart little play ground with an adjacent Tapas restaurant, <a href="http://www.trambar.fr/">the tram bar</a>. Partially housed in an old railway carriage. This is a great and unfortunately rare combination: a restaurant with great reasonably priced food with good fenced in play structures which are easily visible from the restaurant terrace. This is good location to start many waymarked paths into the Jura.
