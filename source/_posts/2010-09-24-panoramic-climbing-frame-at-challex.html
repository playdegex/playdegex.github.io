Located at the top of Challex by the football stadium you get good views of both the Saléve&nbsp;and the Jura.<br /><br />It's grass for a change in between the swings and there's a good picnic table for your lunch.<br /><br />Challex seems to be pretty quiet, &nbsp;the only thing I could hear today was church bells and the genuine sound of Pétanque balls clacking.<br /><br />The particular attraction with the climbing frame here is the little room on top of the climbing frame where children all go and hide out. Challex is a relaxing playground for the parents too.
